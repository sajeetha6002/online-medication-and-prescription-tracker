## Automated Testing Script

Create `test.js`:

```javascript
const assert = require('assert');

// Mock API calls for testing
async function runTests() {
  console.log('🧪 Running automated tests...\n');

  // Test 1: User Registration
  console.log('Test 1: User Registration');
  const signupResponse = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/auth/signup', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      fullName: 'Test User',
      email: 'test@example.com',
      mobile: '1234567890',
      password: 'test123',
      role: 'patient'
    })
  });
  assert.equal(signupResponse.status, 201, 'Signup should return 201');
  console.log('✓ Passed\n');

  // Test 2: Login
  console.log('Test 2: User Login');
  const loginResponse = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      email: 'test@example.com',
      password: 'test123',
      role: 'patient'
    })
  });
  const loginData = await loginResponse.json();
  assert.ok(loginData.token, 'Login should return token');
  console.log('✓ Passed\n');

  // Test 3: Protected Route Without Token
  console.log('Test 3: Protected Route Without Token');
  const noTokenResponse = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/auth/me');
  assert.equal(noTokenResponse.status, 401, 'Should return 401 without token');
  console.log('✓ Passed\n');

  // Test 4: Protected Route With Token
  console.log('Test 4: Protected Route With Token');
  const withTokenResponse = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/auth/me', {
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${loginData.token}` }
  });
  assert.equal(withTokenResponse.status, 200, 'Should return 200 with token');
  console.log('✓ Passed\n');

  console.log('✅ All tests passed!');
}

// Run tests
runTests().catch(console.error);
```

Run with:
```bash
node test.js
```

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing with Apache Bench

```bash
# Test login endpoint
ab -n 1000 -c 10 -p login.json -T application/json http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login

# Test prescription listing (requires auth token)
ab -n 1000 -c 10 -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:3000/api/doctor/prescriptions
```

### Expected Performance

- Login: < 100ms per request
- Data retrieval: < 50ms per request
- Prescription creation: < 200ms per request
- Analytics calculation: < 500ms per request

## Testing Best Practices

1. **Test in Isolation**
   - Each test should be independent
   - Clean up test data after each test

2. **Use Descriptive Names**
   - Test names should describe what they test
   - Example: "should_reject_login_with_wrong_password"

3. **Test Both Happy and Sad Paths**
   - Happy path: Everything works
   - Sad path: Things go wrong

4. **Keep Tests Updated**
   - Update tests when features change
   - Remove tests for removed features

5. **Document Test Results**
   - Keep log of test runs
   - Track failures over time
